Pivot Bio is a revolutionary start-up that is transforming how fertilizer is produced & used by farmers to drive environmental sustainability. In partnership with [Studio Co.llab](https://studiocollab.co/), we evolved Pivot Bio’s digital presence by deepening the website’s user experience with a full-scale website redesign and re-platforming. Along with a full site refresh, we also created an extensive design system to make it easy to create updates internally, without the overhead of having a development team on staff.
