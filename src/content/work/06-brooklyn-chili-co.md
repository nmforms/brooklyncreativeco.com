A friend commissioned me to help create a brand identity for his new local business venture in Brooklyn, New York. He wanted something approachable with a bit of flair to represent the thoughtfulness and care of their cooking process. I worked with him to create a brand experience that focused on the craft of an unpretentious and delicious local sriracha hot sauce brand.
