Foursquare City Guide is a local search and discovery mobile service, providing the best recommendations for places to eat, drink, shop or visit - in any city in the world! Foursquare provides tailored recommendations personalized for every unique user and provides a place to keep track of where you've been and where you want to go, all in one place. During my time there I worked on an array of projects and features, with a primary focus on defining the best approach of bringing innovative and efficient solutions to change and inspire the way users view the world around them.
