Foursquare wanted to embark on a large redesign of their most used page on their City Guide app, Place Pages. Through extensive research, we uncovered an unmet need where users wanted to better understand the full experience of a venue before going there. The redesign focused heavily on the users “evaluation stage”, which was when users were analyzing and deciding if a certain place satisfied what they were searching for.

We built a structure that incorporated many points of interest, while maintaining a simple and easy interface. Foursquare users from around the globe have contributed to a database of over 105 million places. They’ve shown what’s great inside those places by uploading over 630 million photos and writing over 91 million tips. This place page redesign was a way we could really make that content shine.
