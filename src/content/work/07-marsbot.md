Marsbot started off as an internal project at Foursquare with the primary goal of finding new ways to discover the best places around you. Marsbot delivers contextually aware, proactive recommendations for awesome food and nightlife spots via the simplest communications channel possible: text. Although it’s a bot and may seem like it’s primary use case is a chatbot, it’s less conversational and more predictive. Marsbot uses your location and travel patterns to provide suggestions via SMS that are tailored to you and your tastes.
